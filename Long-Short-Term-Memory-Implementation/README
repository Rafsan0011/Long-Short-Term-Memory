This is an implementation of the Deep Learning concept "RNN", specifically "Long Short Term Memory" of RNN on IMDB dataset. 
This was implemented in Python and Tensorflow. Data was procured using:
"path = get_dataset_file(path, "imdb.pkl","http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/data/imdb.pkl"). So you need to be online.
