# Long-Short-Term-Memory

This is a Python and Tensorflow implementation of the deep learning concept "RNN", specifically "LSTM" on IMDB dataset.
Dataset was procured using " path = get_dataset_file(path, "imdb.pkl","http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/data/imdb.pkl")". So you
need to be online.
